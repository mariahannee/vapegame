						<h3>ePuffer XPod – (Editors Choice)</h3>
					</td>
					<td>
						<ul>
							<li>The ePuffer XPod not only looks great but it’s a great kit for vapers that want the option of prefilled and empty refillable pods.</li>
							<li>The kit itself comes with three blank (empty) cartridges that you can use your choice of juice with. Although we recommend nic salts or no more than 60VG ratios.</li>
							<li>As a vaping experience it’s simple. Just take a cartridge out of the packaging, fill with e-liquid (if they aren’t pre-filled) and drop it into the battery. Then simply inhale and you’re vaping. No buttons to press making it one of the best draw activated pod vape.</li>
							<li>Which is what we want right? Despite it being easy to use and setup the performance is excellent. Their own pre-filled nic salt flavoured pods are excellent.</li>
							<li>To finish up it’s a great looking kit that slides into any pocket or bag with ease. Making for a great ‘back pocket’ vape.</li>

						<h3>Apollo Brez – (Best Closed Pod System)</h3>
					</td>
					<td>
						<ul>
							<li>If you are looking for a Juul alternative then the Brez by Apollo is one of the best pre-filled pod devices.
							</li>
							<li>
								The Brez is lightweight but still well built, it’s super compact making it highly portable and barely noticeable in your pocket.
							</li>
							<li>It’s perfect for new vapers that want a device that is simple to use, you can literally pick up this pod and be vaping within minutes or seconds really if you don’t count taking it out of the box.</li>
							<li>One of the things that impressed most was the pod flavours. They rock. The kit comes complete with 5 nic salt pods included.</li>
							<li>Apollo are known for their quality e-liquids and these are no different. Being 20mg nic salts they also hit the spot and satisfy that nic craving quickly.
							</li>
							<li>If you are looking for a good looking pod mod of a certain type and style then this is a great contender.</li>

						<h3>Geek Vape Aegis Boost – (Most Durable Pod System)</h3>
					</td>
					<td>
						<ul>
							<li>
								If you have been following Vape Game for a while you will likely know we like our Aegis vape devices. Not only have Geek Vape produced one of the best vape mods in the Aegis X but they can now lay claim to one of the best pod systems.
							</li>
							<li>
								If you don’t know the Geek Vape Aegis range they have been designed to withstand not only the elements but bumps and knocks. The Aegis Boost pod is no different. This pod is IP67 Waterproof and dust proof as well as shock proof. If you are prone to dropping your vape then this is for you.
							</li>
							<li>It’s not all about these features though. As a performer it is one of the best in class.</li>
							<li>The Boost comes with one top fill pod but the coils can be replaced (Two mesh coils are included). It also comes with two mouthpieces for mouth to lung and direct to lung vaping. To finish off there is also a fully adjustable airflow </li>
							<li>So what about flavour? Both mesh coils deliver bundles of it. Enough said!</li>

						<h3>JAC Vapour Wee VIM – (Best Value Vape Pod)</h3>
					</td>
					<td>
						<ul>
							<li>
								For size, performance and price this was a no brainer for our top rated pod mod list.


							</li>
							<li>
								The JAC Vapour Wee VIM is as simple as it gets for new users while still being a great out and about / backup device for the more experienced.


							</li>
							<li>The Wee Vim is available with pre-filled Vim pods (can be purchased in packs of 3) for plug and play ease of use. These come in 4 flavours that hit the spot and satisfy nicotine cravings – Smoking Tobacco | Smoking Menthol Tobacco | Blackcurrant Squash | Strawberry Chew.

							</li>
							<li>If you want to use your own e-liquid and refill yourself you can opt for the Vim refillable pods.

							</li>
							<li>
								This is great for new vapers as it gives you the option of being a little more adventurous with your e-liquid favours as your vape experience grows. These can be added at a later date.


							</li>
							<li>
								Operating the device is simple with little to no learning curve, simply pop a pod in the battery, press the button and inhale. Even my dad could use this and that’s saying something!
							</li>
							<li>The 900 mAh battery should see most users through the day but when it comes to charging you can vape this while it is plugged in and powering up.</li>
							<li>One of the best things about this kit? The price. It’s a bargain. If you have a smoker in your life it also makes a great little gift.</li>

						<h3>SMOK Nord – (Best Pod System For Replaceable Coils)</h3>
					</td>
					<td>
						<ul>
							<li>
								The SMOK Nord has received rave reviews, it even impressed our Kevin who has never been a pod mod fan. Believe me that takes some doing.
							</li>
							<li>
								One of our other dedicated product testers, Michelle, used this to keep off the cigarettes, in fact she has two in rotation.
							</li>
							<li>
								It has all the usual attributes to make it on to the best pod vape system list such as top build quality, good battery life, great hand feel, all that stuff.
							</li>
							<li>What really impresses is the Nord is that it has replaceable coils rather than buying a whole new pod. Not only that but the 0.6Ohm mesh coil head provides superb flavour as well as decent clouds for such a small device.							</li>
							<li>So it’s a dinky little kit that runs off an impressive 1100mAh battery maxing out at 15 watts.	</li>
							<li>It’s easy to fill, new vapers will have no trouble using this and the press of a button will have you vaping within 10 minutes out of the box.</li>
							<li>For more experienced vapers this is a top notch 2nd device or something that will satisfy when out and about or in situations where a chunky box mod won’t do. The 0.6Ohm mesh coil will definitely do the trick.</li>
							<li>All of this comes at a very reasonable price as well so… yeah, this is definitely a pod mod you should consider buying!</li>

						<h3>Uwell Caliburn – (Best Juul Alternative)</h3>
					</td>
					<td>
						<ul>
							<li>
								Now it’s not the best looking vape pod on the market but when it comes to delivering flavour and overall vape experience it’s up there with the best.
							</li>
							<li>
								The pods are refillable and the battery life is impressive. Not only that but it is super lightweight making for a perfect pocket pod.


							</li>
							<li>
								Above all the Caliburn is one of those kits that is a proper mouth to lung vape. Not too loose, not too airy. Great for smokers making the switch.


							</li>
							<li>
								Refillable pod system

						<h3>Lost Vape Orion DNA Go – (Best Design)</h3>
					</td>
					<td>
						<ul>
							<li>
								Design wise the Lost Vape Orion DNA Go pod mod is one of our favourites, it looks superb and feels great in the hand.
							</li>
							<li>
								In fact, when it comes to performance it sits right near the top of the pile as well. It’s not the cheapest and while it is easy to use out of the box advanced vapers may want to have a play with the settings for optimum performance.


							</li>
							<li>
								This is the first pod mod to include a DNA chip, one of the best vape engines in the market. The DNA Go chip allows you to lock in your perfect draw so it will be repeated every time.


							</li>
							<li>
								Access to the Escribe software may be needed to get that perfect setting but when you have it nailed it vapes like a dream.


							</li>
							<li>
								It certainly is a badass design looking like a little like an old school walky talky but that’s all good in our book!


							</li>
							<li>The pods are refillable but once the coils in the pods die a new pod is needed, these are available on the website below.</li>
							<li>As to vaping the 950mAH internal battery gives a good life that should easily see most vapers through the day before a re-charge is needed.</li>
							<li>If your budget allows then this is a top of the line pod mod that we recommend you add to your shopping cart ASAP.</li>
							<li>
								<a href="https://www.vapesuperstore.co.uk/collections/all/products/lost-vape-orion-dna-aio-pod-kit?affc=29a525ce-4ebf-49b1-8d05-86e96890bae1"><em>CLICK HERE TO BUY</em></a>

						<h3>SMOK MICO – (Best For Size – This is tiny)</h3>
					</td>
					<td>
						<ul>
							<li>
								They say small things come in small packages and that is certainly true when it comes to the SMOK Mico pod mod.


							</li>
							<li>
								As the name ‘almost’ suggests this is micro, measuring in at 56.3mm × 46.5mm × 14.8mm and weighing just 65g. This fits with ease into a jeans coin pocket. Or at least on my jeans and makes for a great stealth vape.


							</li>
							<li>
								Some pods can feel a little on the cheap side but this feels quality in the hand and looks the business. The 1.7ml e-liquid capacity isn’t the biggest (only .3ml off the max allowed in Europe) but it’s a price worth paying for tiny.


							</li>
							<li>The 700 mAh battery is also good for the size and should see you through 4-5 hours of use depending of course on your vape style.</li>
							<li>Included in the kit are 2 x pods, one regular 1.0Ohm coil and one 0.8ohm Mesh coil. Both perform really well with good life to boot.</li>
							<li>The whole point of pod system vapes is that they are easy for new vapers to use. The Mico is as easy as they come. Once the tank is full you don’t even need to press a button to vape, this is draw activated.</li>
							<li>If small is what you want then look no further.</li>

						<h3>Uwell Amulet (Best Pod Watch Vape)</h3>
					</td>
					<td>
						<ul>
							<li>
								Yes.. The Uwell Amulet is a pod watch. We fully expected this to be all gimmick but it turned out to be a top notch portable pod mod.


							</li>
							<li>
								Despite weighing in at just 27g the Amulet features a 370mAh battery and 2ml pod capacity. You barely notice it on your wrist.


							</li>
							<li>
								What really surprised us is that the performance with nic salt e-juice, the flavour was very good.


							</li>
							<li>
								So if you like your smart watches (Yes this does tell the time as well) and fancy a back up vape on your wrist then the Amulet is your man.
